# ILoveZappos

I have created a search Module for the Zappos Android App. When the user searched for a product, an API call is made and the list of products are being displayed. When a product is clicked, a detail view of the product is shown to the user. 

The data binding has been provided in the product details page. 
Animation for the add to cart Floating Action Button has also been implemented in the app. 
Have handled the Configuration changes of the app ensuring the scalability across various devices.
Used Retrofit for handling the API requests.
“Share” a product and when the other user has the app installed, when the shared link is clicked, the appropriate product page is opened and displayed. 
Followed Material design guidelines for the app. 

I have also included some additional features to make the app user friendly. 

Store previously searched products and enable the offline mode, thereby providing the user to lookup the product even when offline. 
Provided a list of Recently Viewed products in the home page for the user to navigate easily between the products recently viewed.
Provided a list of similar items (if any) in the products view page by enabling the user to navigate between similar products providing uninterrupted shopping experience. 

I have made use of the API I had and tried to extract and showcase as much information as I could in multiple ways to make the user experience great and smooth! 

I have tested the app in multiple real devices such as:

1.	Nexus 6P – Android 7.1.1 
2.	ASUS_Z00LD – Android 6.0.1
3.	MI PAD Tablet – Android 4.4.4
