# ILoveZappos

I have created a search Module for the Zappos Android App. When the user searched for a product, an API call is made and the list of products are being displayed. When a product is clicked, a detail view of the product is shown to the user. 

 The data binding has been provided in the product details page.
 Animation for the add to cart Floating Action Button has also been implemented in the app.
 Have handled the Configuration changes of the app ensuring the scalability across various devices.
 Used Retrofit for handling the API requests.
 “Share” a product and when the other user has the app installed, when the shared link is clicked, the appropriate product page is opened and displayed.
 Followed Material design guidelines for the app. 

I have also included some additional features to make the app user friendly. 

 Store previously searched products and enable the offline mode, thereby providing the user to lookup the product even when offline.
 Provided a list of Recently Viewed products in the home page for the user to navigate easily between the products recently viewed.
 Provided a list of similar items (if any) in the products view page by enabling the user to navigate between similar products providing uninterrupted shopping experience.
 Provided the Shopping cart page thereby tracking and displaying all the items added to the cart.

I have made use of the API I had and tried to extract and showcase as much information as I could in multiple ways to make the user experience great and smooth! 

I have tested the app in multiple real devices such as:

1.	Nexus 6P – Android 7.1.1 
2.	ASUS_Z00LD – Android 6.0.1
3.	MI PAD Tablet – Android 4.4.4

The Screenshot of the app is as follows:
